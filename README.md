## Snake Game in Java

--A simple implementation of classic snake game in java. This project features:

1.Grid-based gameplay with adjustable tile size and board size.

2.Snake movement controlled via the keyboard (W, A, S, D).

3.Food mechanics, where the snake grows each time it eats.

4.Game-over condition when the snake collides with itself or the wall.

5.Timer-based game loop to manage the gameâ€™s progression.

6.Smooth graphics rendering using Java's Graphics and Timer classes.

--This project aims to demonstrate basic game development concepts like collision detection, input handling, and real-time rendering in Java.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
